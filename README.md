# Jarvis-Ollama-Python
Creating Jarvis Virtual Assistant with Voice with Ollama integration rather than OpenAI API usage.

Why to use an Open AI API key when you can go ahead for you know ollama (local hosted AI). 
More safer, more PRIVATE, and more secure.

The features that I have added in this are: todo list, opening applications through command and calculations and of course since AI is there, you can generate stuff like ANYTHING. 

You add on any AI that you like and further since this is customizable, you can go on and change things for yourself
(example: deepseek-r1, gemma3:4b and mistral:7b [But remember to pull these models first in ollama and then add to it])


Sadly as for now I have made this for Windows operating systems (Linux coming soon by end of year)

And plus, this was my first project based on whatever I had heard out my 100 days of bootcamp certification course, so
its gonna be a bit bad and no so you know HIGH end but rather basic. 
But yeah with time (like I will try to amend it every month I guess), you will notice remarkable differences. 


Thank you and ENJOY
